# Swinging-Strikes
Plotting swinging strikes for Kris Bryant and Jose Abreu
I'm using Statcast data from MLB's Baseball Savant website to take a look at all swinging strikes from Kris Bryant (CHC) and Jose Abreu (CWS) so far in the 2021 season.
Using guidance from the fantastic "Analyzing Baseball Data with R" book I'm plotting the locations of all swinging strikes for the two players.
For future iterations of this project, I'll be taking a look at which pitches they see most frequently and which pitches they most frequently swing at.
I'll also examine the location of the off-speed pitches they face and what counts they are likely to see an off-speed pitch.
Seeing as the plot is from the catcher's point of view, my hypothesis is that many of the off-speed pitches the two hitters will see will be low and outside.
